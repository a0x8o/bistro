# We generally need to track folly here, or the build may break.  E.g.
# having `gnu++14` here became incompatible with folly built with `gnu++1z`.
#
# An example failure due to having C++14 is like so:
#   undefined reference to `folly::ThreadedRepeatingFunctionRunner::add(
#     std::__cxx11::basic_string<char,
#         std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >,

#     std::chrono::duration<long, std::ratio<1l, 1000l> >)'
# This is because the `Function` is declared as `noexcept` in `folly`, and
# as of C++17, this annotation is part of the ABI.  But if we compile with
# C++14, it looks for an unannotated overload.
